Forest Adventure game.
In this adventure game, you play as a pet trainer seeking a rare herb to save your injured friend. After logging in and creating your pet with 500 points across attack, health, and speed, you venture into a dangerous forest. Youâ€™ll encounter enemies like a dummy, a glass cannon, and a silent beast. Choose to fight or hide. In battle, you can attack, charge (for exponential damage), or dodge. Each choice affects your endingâ€”win by force or avoid conflict for a secret peaceful ending. Choose wisely; strategy and restraint may be your greatest weapons.

ðŸŒ¿ Pet Battle Game â€“ How to Win

    Build Your Pet Wisely
    Assign 500 points. For easy wins:

        High speed helps you dodge and act first.

        High attack ends fights quickly.

        Enough HP keeps you alive.

    Understand Each Enemy

        Trainer Dummy: Weak. Attack normally.

        Glass Cannon: Strong attack but low HP. Go first and strike hard.

        BleedingLion: Tough, but loses HP every turn. Survive and let it bleed.

        SleepingTiger: Harmless unless attacked. Charge and one-shot it.

    Use Your Skills

        Attack: Deals normal damage.

        Charge: Doubles your next attack. Stacks up to 6 times (very strong!).

        Dodge: Avoid one enemy hit. Best when your speed is high.

    Hidden Ending Tip
    Choose hide every time to unlock the Forest Guardian ending.
